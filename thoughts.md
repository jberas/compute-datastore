#### Thoughts and assumptions

- Testing was limited due to costs
- IAM policy for s3 and dynamoDB could be scoped tighter
- Using cloud init as a standardized means to install binaries
- Installing AWS CLI to be able to interact with s3 or dynamo
- Github actions creates releases for module  based on Conventional Commits
